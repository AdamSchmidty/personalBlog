# Hello World: My First Blog Post

Welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to share my journey in web development and technology.

## What I'll be writing about

In this blog, I'll be covering:

- **Web Development**: Next.js, React, and modern JavaScript
- **Content Management**: Using Contentlayer for structured content
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS and modern design practices
- **Performance**: Optimization techniques and best practices

## Getting Started

This blog is built with:

- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **Contentlayer 2** for content management
- **MDX** for enhanced markdown
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **TypeScript** for type safety

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

Stay tuned for more posts about web development, coding tips, and technology insights!
